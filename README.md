my take on how notes and srs should be combind and simplified

## Usage

The project includes a `Makefile` for common tasks:

- **Build**: `make build` (creates binary in `bin/mend`)
- **Test**: `make test`
- **Run**: `make run` (automatically scaffolds `test_data` directory and runs app against it)
- **Scaffold**: `make scaffold` (generates sample data in `test_data`)
- **Clean**: `make clean` (removes binary)
- **Clean Data**: `make clean-data` (removes `test_data` directory)
